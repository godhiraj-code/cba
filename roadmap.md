# CBA Vision: The "Starlight Protocol" Roadmap

To evolve from a prototype to a world-class, production-grade protocol, CBA must shift from "Reactive Healing" to "Proactive Intelligence." This roadmap outlines the trajectory to handle any website at enterprise scale.

## Phase 1: Protocol Standardization (Starlight v2.0)
The core communication between Hub and Sentinels must be codified into a formal specification.

- **Formal JSON-RPC Schema**: Define strict types for `PRE_CHECK`, `HIJACK`, `RESUME`, and `HEARTBEAT`.
- **Bidirectional Auras**: Allow Sentinels to not just "clear obstacles" but "enrich state" (e.g., a "Data Sentinel" that populates a global context for the Intent Layer).
- **Latency Quotas**: Enforce strict millisecond budgets for Sentinel handshakes to prevent performance degradation.

## Phase 2: The "Visionary" Layer (AI-Driven Healing)
Moving beyond selector-based pattern matching to visual/semantic understanding.

- **Local SLM Integration**: Deploy Small Language Models (like Llama/Phi) within "Vision Sentinels" to identify "Obstacles" purely by visual context (e.g., "this looks like a cookie banner") without needing CSS/XPath.
- **Self-Healing Selectors**: If a Sentinel clears an obstacle, it should broadcast the "Corrected Path" back to the Hub's persistent memory to optimize future runs.

## Phase 3: Enterprise Scalability & Cloud Sentinels
CBA must move from a local "Sidecar" to a distributed "Fleet."

- **Cloud Orchestrator**: A managed Hub that can spin up Sentinels in isolated containers across a global cluster.
- **Sentinel Marketplace**: Plug-and-play "Auras" for complex third-party platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Stripe, AWS Console).
- **Security Hardening**: E2E encryption for the WebSocket bus and secure "Historian" Sentinels for credential rotation.

## Phase 4: Developer Ecosystem (The CBA SDK)
Making it the "Universal Language" of automation.

- **Multi-Language SDKs**: Official CBA client libraries for Java, C#, Python, and Golang.
- **CBA-CLI**: A powerful command-line tool for scaffolding Sentinels, debugging Starlight signals, and inspecting "Hero Story" timelines.
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension to visualize the "Stars" (Auras) while writing Intent scripts.

## Phase 5: World-Class Reliability (The "Omega" Hub)
Achieving 99.9% Test Stability.

- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Record the entire "Constellation" state to allow replaying a failed "Hero Story" at any exact millisecond for triage.
- **Chaos Injection**: A built-in "Chaos Sentinel" that intentionally breaks the environment during execution to stress-test the healing layers of a new application.
