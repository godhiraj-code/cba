# 🛰️ CBA World-Class Roadmap: The "Universal Starlight" Strategy

To transform Constellation-Based Automation from a smart framework into a global automation paradigm, we must move from **Reactive Healing** to **Sovereign Intelligence**.

---

## 🟢 PHASE 1: The Core Protocol (COMPLETED)
*Establish the foundational Sidecar Architecture.*
- **Starlight v2.0**: JSON-RPC 2.0 message bus implementation. [DONE]
- **Priority Handshaking**: Multi-sentinel coordination (Janitor vs Pulse). [DONE]
- **Business ROI Reporting**: Autonomous "Hero Story" report generation. [DONE]

## 🟢 PHASE 2: AI Visionary Layer (COMPLETED)
*Integrate Local SLMs for visual, selector-free resilience.*
- **Local Vision Pulse**: `moondream` integration for visual obstacle detection. [DONE]
- **Hybrid Healing**: 25s AI budget with seamless heuristic fallback. [DONE]
- **Sovereign Hijack**: Priority-based browser control for AI intervention. [DONE]

## 🟢 PHASE 3: Temporal Stability & Network Pulse (COMPLETED)
*Eliminating "Flakiness" at the source: Network & DOM Jitter.*
- **The Pulse Sentinel**: Specialized agent for Network/DOM mutation monitoring. [DONE]
- **Auto-Wait Handshake**: Hub-level execution delay based on environment stability. [DONE]
- **Wait-Less Execution**: Removal of manual `setTimeout` from intent scripts. [DONE]

## 🟢 PHASE 4: Decentralized Sentinel Mesh (COMPLETED)
*Scaling CBA across distributed environments.*
- **Sovereign Context Injection**: Shared intelligence across the constellation. [DONE]
- **The Starlight SDK**: Standardized base class for rapid Sentinel development. [DONE]
- **Data Sentinel**: Example agent performing passive intelligence extraction. [DONE]

## 🟢 PHASE 5: Semantic Intent & Mission Planning (COMPLETED)
*Moving from "Clicking" to "Goal Achievement."*
- **Semantic Resolver**: Hub-level translation of goals (e.g., "INITIATE MISSION") to selectors. [DONE]
- **Dynamic ID Resilience**: Handling randomly generated attributes via semantic scanning. [DONE]
- **The Cosmic Challenge**: A world-class stress test of the full autonomous fleet. [DONE]

---

## 🟢 PHASE 6: The "Omega" Standard & Ecosystem (COMPLETED)
*Achieving World-Class Paradigm Status.*
- **Starlight Certification**: A formal ISO-like standard for "Resilient Test Infrastructure." [DONE]
- **CBA Cloud Orchestrator**: A global, managed Hub that spins up ephemeral browsers and Sentinels on demand. [DONE]
- **Time-Travel Triage**: The ability to "Rewind" a failed mission and inspect the exact handshake logs. [DONE]

## 🛰️ NEXT: PHASE 7: The "Galaxy" Mesh (Predictive Intelligence)
*Moving from Reactive Healing to Predictive Avoidance.*
- **Self-Healing Selectors**: Use `mission_trace.json` history to automatically suggest substitutes for failed selectors. [DONE]
- **Aura-Based Throttling**: Dynamic Hub frequency adjustment based on historical environmental entropy. [DONE]
- **Sentinel Learning**: Persistent memory for Sentinels to optimize corrective actions over time. [DONE]

## 🟢 PHASE 8: The Starlight Ecosystem (DevX) (COMPLETED)
*Transforming CBA into a formal Developer Toolset.*
- **Centralized Configuration**: All settings externalized to `config.json`. [DONE]
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handlers for clean sentinel termination. [DONE]
- **SDK Hardening**: Atomic writes, proper exceptions, auto-reconnect. [DONE]
- **Screenshot Cleanup**: Auto-removes files older than 24h. [DONE]
- **Trace Rotation**: Limits mission trace to 500 events. [DONE]
- **Starlight CLI**: Advanced project scaffolding and constellation management. [PLANNED]

## 🛡️ PHASE 9: Sovereign Security & Compliance
*Turning CBA into a Shield for Enterprise Environments.*
- **Shadow DOM Penetration**: Advanced deep-piercing selectors for encapsulated web components.
- **PII Sentinel**: Passive sentinel for detecting and alerting on sensitive data in the UI.
- **Traffic Sovereign**: Network-level request manipulation and chaos engineering via the Hub.

## 🟢 PHASE 10: Observability  

## 🟢 PHASE 11: Hub as a service

## 🟢 PHASE 12: Accessibility , WCAG 2.1 automated audit and compliance

## 🟢 PHASE 13: Cross Browser and Mobile Constellation (Android, iOS)

## 🟢 PHASE 14: Plugin market place - Sentinel Store, Plugin SDK 

## 🟢 PHASE 15: Visual editor for non developes , business users, managers to build sentinel

### 🛡️ MISSION STATUS: STARLIGHT v2.7 OPERATIONAL
CBA has made the **Environment** irrelevant to the **Goal**. Whether the UI changes, popups appear, or the network lags—the Starlight Protocol ensures the journey reaches its destination.
